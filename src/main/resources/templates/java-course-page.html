    <h1>Java Theory</h1>

    <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
    <p>
        Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Platform independence: Java programs can run on any operating system or device with a Java Virtual Machine
            (JVM) installed.
        </li>
        <li>Object-oriented programming: Java supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it suitable
            for building modular and reusable code.
        </li>
        <li>Automatic memory management: Java uses a garbage collector to automatically deallocate memory occupied by
            objects that are no longer in use.
        </li>
        <li>Robust and secure: Java includes features like exception handling, type checking, and security mechanisms to
            ensure reliable and secure code execution.
        </li>
        <li>Rich standard library: Java provides a vast standard library that offers a wide range of classes and methods
            for common programming tasks.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
    <p>
        Java programs are written in plain text files with a .java extension. The basic syntax of a Java program
        consists of classes, methods, variables, statements, and expressions.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Types in Java</h2>
    <p>
        Java supports various data types, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and char.</li>
        <li>Reference data types: classes, interfaces, arrays, and enumerated types.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Variables in Java</h2>
    <p>
        Variables in Java are used to store and manipulate data. Here are some key points about variables:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Variables must be declared with a specific data type, such as int, double, or String.</li>
        <li>Variable names should start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($), and can include letters,
            digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
        </li>
        <li>Java is case-sensitive, so "myVariable" and "myvariable" are considered different variables.</li>
        <li>Variables can be assigned initial values when declared, or they can be assigned values later in the
            program.
        </li>
        <li>Variables can be updated by assigning them new values using the assignment operator (=).</li>
        <li>The final keyword can be used to declare constants, which hold values that cannot be modified.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Operators in Java</h2>
    <p>
        Java provides a variety of operators for performing operations on variables and values. Here are some commonly
        used operators:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus).</li>
        <li>Assignment operators: = (simple assignment), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment), *=
            (multiplication assignment), /= (division assignment), %= (modulus assignment).
        </li>
        <li>Comparison operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or
            equal to), <= (less than or equal to).
        </li>
        <li>Logical operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT).</li>
        <li>Increment and decrement operators: ++ (increment by 1), -- (decrement by 1).</li>
        <li>Bitwise operators: & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), ~ (bitwise complement).</li>
        <li>Ternary operator: ? : (conditional operator that assigns a value based on a condition).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Java Keywords</h2>
    <p>
        Java has a set of reserved words, called keywords, that have predefined meanings in the language. Here are some
        commonly used Java keywords:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>break</li>
        <li>catch</li>
        <li>char</li>
        <li>class</li>
        <li>continue</li>
        <li>else</li>
        <li>enum</li>
        <li>extends</li>
        <li>for</li>
        <li>this</li>
        <li>while</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Control Statements</h2>
    <p>
        Control statements in Java allow you to control the flow of execution in your program. Here are some commonly
        used control statements:
    </p>

    <h3>If-else Statement</h3>
    <p>
        The if-else statement allows you to execute a block of code based on a condition. It has the following syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
int number = 10;
if (number > 0) {
  System.out.println("The number is positive");
} else {
  System.out.println("The number is negative");
}
</pre>

    <h3>Switch Statement</h3>
    <p>
        The switch statement allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It has the following syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if the expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if the expression matches value2
    break;
  default:
    // code to be executed if the expression doesn't match any case
}
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
int day = 3;
String dayName;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Unknown";
}
System.out.println("The day is " + dayName);
</pre>
    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>
        Loops in Java allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. Here are some commonly used loop statements:
    </p>

    <h3>For Loop</h3>
    <p>
        The for loop is used to iterate a block of code for a specified number of times. It has the following syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code to be executed in each iteration
}
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
</pre>

    <h3>While Loop</h3>
    <p>
        The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true. It has the
        following syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
  System.out.println("Count: " + i);
  i++;
}
</pre>

    <h3>Do-While Loop</h3>
    <p>
        The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the
        condition. It has the following syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>
do {
  // code to be executed
} while (condition);
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
int i = 1;
do {
  System.out.println("Count: " + i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 5);
</pre>
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>
        Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values of the same data type. Here's how you can work with arrays in
        Java:
    </p>

    <h3>Declaration and Initialization</h3>
    <p>
        To declare an array, you need to specify the data type of the elements it will store, followed by square
        brackets ([]), and the array name. You can then initialize the array with values using the assignment operator
        (=) and the array initializer syntax.
    </p>
    <pre>
data_type[] array_name = new data_type[] {value1, value2, value3, ...};
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
int[] numbers = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
String[] names = new String[] {"John", "Mary", "David"};
</pre>

    <h3>Accessing Array Elements</h3>
    <p>
        Array elements can be accessed using their index, which starts from 0. You can access an element by specifying
        the array name followed by the index enclosed in square brackets ([]).
    </p>
    <pre>
array_name[index]
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Accessing the first element
String[] names = {"John", "Mary", "David"};
String firstName = names[0]; // Accessing the first element
</pre>

    <h3>Array Length</h3>
    <p>
        The length property of an array can be used to get the number of elements in the array.
    </p>
    <pre>
array_name.length
</pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int length = numbers.length; // Getting the length of the array
</pre>
    <h2>Collections in Java</h2>
    <p>
        Collections in Java provide a way to store and manipulate groups of objects. They offer more functionality and
        flexibility compared to arrays. Here are some commonly used collection interfaces and classes in Java:
    </p>

    <h3>List Interface</h3>
    <p>
        The List interface represents an ordered collection of elements where duplicates are allowed. Some
        implementations of the List interface include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.
    </p>

    <h3>Set Interface</h3>
    <p>
        The Set interface represents a collection of unique elements where duplicates are not allowed. Some
        implementations of the Set interface include HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.
    </p>

    <h3>Map Interface</h3>
    <p>
        The Map interface represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Some implementations of
        the Map interface include HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.
    </p>

    <h3>Iterator Interface</h3>
    <p>
        The Iterator interface allows you to iterate over elements in a collection. It provides methods to check if
        there are more elements and to retrieve the next element.
    </p>
    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java</h2>
    <p>
        Java is an object-oriented programming language that incorporates several key features of OOP. These features
        enable the organization and structuring of code in a modular and reusable manner. The core OOP features in Java
        include:
    </p>

    <h3>Classes and Objects</h3>
    <p>
        Classes are the building blocks of Java programs. They define the structure, behavior, and properties of
        objects. Objects are instances of classes and represent individual entities in a program. They encapsulate data
        and behavior within a single unit.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
class Car {
  // Properties
  String brand;
  String color;

  // Constructor
  Car(String brand, String color) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.color = color;
  }

  // Method
  void startEngine() {
    System.out.println("Engine started");
  }
}

// Creating objects
Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Red");
myCar.startEngine();
</pre>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>
        Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (subclasses) based on existing classes (superclasses). It allows
        subclasses to inherit and extend the attributes and behaviors of their superclasses. Inheritance promotes code
        reuse and supports hierarchical relationships between classes.
    </p>
    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
    <p>
        Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their own class or their superclass. It enables the
        flexibility to use objects of different types interchangeably. Polymorphism is achieved through method
        overriding and method overloading.
    </p>
    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <p>
        Encapsulation is the bundling of data and related behaviors (methods) into a single unit called a class. It
        hides the internal implementation details of an object and provides access to its properties and methods through
        well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation ensures data integrity and facilitates code maintainability.
    </p>

    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    <p>
        Abstraction focuses on representing essential features and behaviors of objects while hiding unnecessary
        details. It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define common characteristics and
        behaviors to be implemented by concrete classes. Abstraction helps achieve modularity and separation of
        concerns.
    </p>

    <h3>Interfaces</h3>
    <p>
        Interfaces define a contract specifying a set of methods that a class implementing the interface must implement.
        They provide a way to achieve multiple inheritances in Java and facilitate loose coupling between classes.
        Interfaces define a common set of behaviors that can be shared across different classes.
    </p>

    <h3>Composition</h3>
    <p>
        Composition is a form of object composition where objects are combined to create more complex objects. It
        involves creating a class that contains references to other objects as member variables. Composition allows
        building complex relationships and reusing existing functionality by creating objects that collaborate with each
        other.
    </p>

    <h3>Association</h3>
    <p>
        Association represents a relationship between two or more objects where each object maintains its separate
        identity. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship. Objects can interact with each
        other through their associated relationships, enabling collaboration and interaction in a system.
    </p>
    <h2>Exception Handling in Java</h2>
    <p>
        Exception handling in Java allows for the graceful handling of runtime errors, known as exceptions. It helps
        prevent program crashes and provides a mechanism to recover from exceptional situations. Java provides a robust
        exception handling framework that includes the following key components:
    </p>

    <h3>Try-Catch Blocks</h3>
    <p>
        The try-catch block is used to enclose a section of code that might throw an exception. It allows you to catch
        and handle specific types of exceptions. If an exception occurs within the try block, the corresponding catch
        block is executed, allowing you to handle the exception gracefully.
    </p>
    <h3>Throwing Exceptions</h3>
    <p>
        In Java, you can explicitly throw an exception using the <code>throw</code> keyword. This allows you to create
        custom exceptions or propagate built-in exceptions. Throwing an exception interrupts the normal flow of
        execution and transfers control to the nearest catch block that can handle the exception.
    </p>
    <h3>Finally Block</h3>
    <p>
        The finally block is optional and is used to define code that should be executed regardless of whether an
        exception occurs or not. It is typically used to release resources, such as closing database connections or file
        streams, ensuring they are properly handled, even in the event of an exception.
    </p>
    <h3>Exception Types</h3>
    <p>
        Java provides a hierarchy of exception types, with the root class being <code>java.lang.Exception</code>. There
        are two main types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions are checked at
        compile-time and must be explicitly handled or declared. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time
        and can be handled optionally.
